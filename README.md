# Reel-ize Movie Finder

Reel-ize movie finder is like the "Shazam", but for movies. By uploading any still picture from a scene of a movie with at least one actor in it, our application will call our custom age and facial-detection models to try to predict the actors, actor ages, and movie that the scene is from. 

The age model is built using a ResNet50V2 regressor backbone with a custom CNN head. The facial recognition model is built upon ArcFace and DeepFace.

With our preliminary testing, we found that the application is accurate on some stills (especially ones with more than one actor is can positively identify), but inaccurate on others. These are due to underfitting of our age and facial models.
